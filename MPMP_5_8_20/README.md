  Alternatively, download <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11_WW4gFfK7RpsMhcUbvoCFffVi3-90Rq/view?usp=sharing">this Application zip file</a> and chose the correct application for your system*</body>
  
<h2>Usage</h2>
<body>At the top of <a href="MPMP_5_8_20.pde">MPMP_5_8_20.pde</a> there are two booleans which control the visuals: saving a gif, just animating the search, or making the calculations and saving the results to a json file.  This can be put in a spreadsheet or converted to a csv file (comma seperated values) using <a href="out/converter.py">converter.py.</a> Everything else can be manipulated if you know Java and/or Processing. These changes will only take effect in the <a href="https://processing.org/download/">Processing App</a></body>
